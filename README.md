# Example NextJS App for CMD interview

Since the task requirements are pretty much the same as my usual tech stack, for faster setup it is heavily inspired by my favorite starter [T3](https://create.t3.gg/) template. It is using:

- ‚ù§Ô∏è [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/) - package manager (feel free to use `npm` or `yarn`, project should be compatible anyway)
- ‚ù§Ô∏è [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) - React Framework
- ‚ù§Ô∏è [Prisma](https://prisma.io) - ORM for database
- ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ùå [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) - CSS framework, unfortunately not very compatible with Ant Design library, so it was removed
- ‚ù§Ô∏è [tRPC](https://trpc.io) - End-to-end typesafe API
- ‚ù§Ô∏è [TanStack Query](https://trpc.io) - powerful asynchronous state management, included within tRPC
- ‚ù§Ô∏è [useSWR](https://trpc.io) - React Hooks for Data Fetching
- ‚ù§Ô∏è [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - all wrapped with this "no-go-without" strongly typed programming language

Yes, I love all of these.

## Feedback

### Ant Design

- Nice docs, however some things not work, e.g. expanding some code examples.
- Learning new UI library for interview example seems very pricy to me for the outcome of skills which it shows... But overall nice experience.

### G2.antv

- Link for [G2.antv](https://g2.antv.vision/en/examples/gallery) from task description doesn't work.
- Sorry, I must be honest, unusable library documentation. Whole docs are in Chinese some missing, API in examples missing, some pages blank...
- However, I made it through somehow üôÉ

### API

- Maybe would be helpful to share specific data API which are supposed to be used for this example. I am not sure if time spent on searching API docs was worth it.

### tRPC

- Awesome! I very enjoyed using something which I am already "playing" with on my projects üôÇ

### Other

- I hope, that it is not issue that I've used some more libraries which I use on daily basis. It balanced a little bit of time which I've spent on listing docs of UI library and data API. But I would be able without problem use bare code if necessary.
- This is the most complex interview task which I've ever done (mostly because of UI charts library). Of course there can be lot of stuff improved, but I like the current result. Hope you will too! üôÇ
