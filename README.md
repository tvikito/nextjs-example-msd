# Example NextJS App for CMD interview

Since the task requirements are pretty much the same as my usual tech stack, for faster setup it is heavily inspired by my favorite starter [T3](https://create.t3.gg/) template. It is using:

- [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/) - package manager (feel free to use `npm` or `yarn`, project should be compatible anyway)
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) - React Framework
- [Prisma](https://prisma.io) - ORM for database
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) - CSS framework
- [tRPC](https://trpc.io) - End-to-end typesafe API
